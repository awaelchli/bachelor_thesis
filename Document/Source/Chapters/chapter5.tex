\label{chp:Implementation_and_Assessment}

All algorithms discussed in this work are realized in \mbox{MATLAB}, a programming language specialized on matrix manipulations.
It is especially useful for high-dimensional matrix operations, such as the ones for this work.

The following text explains the implementation of the theoretical models and concepts discussed in the previous chapters.

\section{Requirements}

For the implementation and physical realization, some 

The input light field for the optimization algorithm is expected to be a five dimensional array $L$ with entries $L_{ijklc}$, where pairs $(i, j)$ and $(k, l)$ correspond to the angular- and spatial coordinates, and $c$ indexes the color channel. 
It is also assumed that the light field is rectified such that indices $i, j$ conform to global coordinates on the $(s, t)$-plane as explained in section~\ref{sec:light_field_aquisition}.
In addition, the baseline as well as the distance between the two planes are a required input for the system.

The attenuator is defined by the number of layers, resolution, size and thickness.
Each layer has the same dimensions and resolution and is modeled to be infinitely thin.

\section{Attenuator Tiling and Blending}

High resolution light fields can take up a significant amount of space in memory. 
For example, a light field taken with a Full HD camera from $17 \times 17$ angles would take up $1920 \cdot 1080 \cdot 17^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 8 / (1024^3) = 13.3947$ Gigabyte of memory. 
In addition, the propagation matrix stores information about every pixel in the light field and thus, can take up Gigabytes of space depending on the resolution of the attenuation layers. 
The proposed approach divides the attenuation layers into tiles. 
Figure~\ref{fig:tiling_layout} shows how the tiles are laid out.

			 (b) The sum of the per-tile quadratic blending masks used for the normalization.}
\end{figure} 
The inputs for the tiling algorithm are the resolution of the tiles $r = (r_x, r_y)$ and the overlap in horizontal and vertical direction, $o = (o_x, o_y)$. 
The tiles are then laid out in a grid beginning in the top left corner of the layer. 
The number of tiles needed to cover the plane can be calculated by 
\begin{equation}
	N_x = \left \lceil \dfrac{R_x - o_x}{r_x - o_x} \right \rceil
	\qquad 
	\text{and} 
	\qquad
	N_y = \left \lceil \dfrac{R_y - o_y}{r_y - o_y} \right \rceil.
\end{equation}
The combination of the same tile from each layer forms a new attenuator of smaller size and lower resolution. 
The optimization is then performed for every tile separately, resulting in a smaller propagation matrix per tile. 
In the end, the optimized tiles are put together to form the complete attenuation layers. 

In general, the borders of the attenuator contain less ray-propagation information and thus provide a higher degree of freedom for the optimization. 
This introduces artifacts that are clearly visible in the reassembled layers as shown in figure~\ref{fig:comparison_tile_overlap_vs_no_overlap}.

\end{figure} 
To solve this issue, the tiles have to overlap. 
In this case, when reassembling the layers from the tiles, the overlaps need to be blended with a mask:
After the optimization, each tile gets multiplied with a quadratic blending mask.
The finished layers are then obtained by summing the tiles and dividing by the sum of the blending masks shown in figure~\ref{fig:sum_of_quadratic_blending_masks}.
