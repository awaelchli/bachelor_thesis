\section{Printing}
\label{sec:Printing}

The exported PDF file(s) with the attenuation masks can directly be printed with any device that supports transparencies.
The attenuation layers for this project have been printed with an old HP Photosmart C5180 ink-jet printer.
The built-in photo-printing mode turned out to work best, but all automatic image enhancement settings (e.g. red-eye removal) must be turned off in the advanced settings.
Also, ink-jet printers require special types of transparencies that have a rough surface such that the ink can hold on to the sheet.

\section{Backlight Fabrication}
\label{sec:backlight_fabrication}

For an optimal viewing experience, a uniform backlight is needed to place behind the glass plates which hold the printed transparencies.
LEDs are the optimal choice for a simple white backlight: They are small sized, power saving, affordable and don't produce a lot of heat when turned on.
The ones used for this build are average, consumer grade quality LEDs bought on Amazon.
A detailed specification of the product is given in table~\ref{tbl:LED_specs}.

\end{table}
A five meter long and 10 mm wide LED strip is cut into pieces of 15 cm length, each having nine LEDs.
These smaller strips are placed next to each other and glued onto a wooden plate forming the base for the backlight.
Corresponding ends of the strips are reconnected by soldering small pieces of wire onto the contacts of the strips.
For an easier soldering process and to reduce the risk of an electrical short, the strips are alternately offset by a small amount as shown in figure~\ref{fig:look_inside_backlight_2}.

	\label{fig:hand_crafted_backlight}
\end{figure}
A connector for the power supply is mounted on one end of the strip.
Wooden stand-offs glued to the base hold the diffuser plate 17 mm above the LEDs.
The diffuser is simply a white, milky acrylic plate from a hardware store, cut to the right size.
Finally, the build is concluded with a wooden frame covering the LEDs and wires and holding the glass plates in place.
The frame has a diagonal of 23 cm, is 5 cm thick and is painted with a color varnish to protect the wood from scratches and to beautify the product.

A total of three backlights were produced for this project.
All three displays are powered by a 12V/6A DC power supply.
The set also includes a remote control to turn the displays on and off or to adjust the brightness level.

\section{More Simulated Projections}
\label{sec:simulated_projections}

The following pages show simulated projections from various scenes displayed with the attenuation display.
All the examples here have display parameters that correspond to the displays shown in figures~\ref{fig:glass_display} and~\ref{fig:hand_crafted_backlight}.
Five layers are equally spaced to form a 1.6 cm thick stack.
\mbox{SART} is used with 50 iterations.
All computations were performed on a Intel Quad Core i7 3770K CPU with 8 Gigabyte of RAM.
The baseline has been manually adjusted such that the desired depth range is approximately within the displays depth of field.
Each simulated view is labeled with an index $(i, j)$ that corresponds to the location of the virtual camera on the \mbox{$(u, v)$-plane} where $i$ denotes the vertical placement from top to bottom and $j$ denotes the horizontal placement from left to right.
The images below each simulation show the per-pixel \mbox{RMSE} over the three color channels.
High error is visualized with yellow and red color and bluish colors indicate low error.
