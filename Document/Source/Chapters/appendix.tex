\section{Backlight Fabrication}
\todo{Add dimensions of the display and frame}

For an optimal viewing experience, a uniform backlight is needed to place behind the glass plates which hold the printed transparencies.
LEDs are the optimal choice for a simple white backlight: They are small sized, power saving, affordable and don't produce a lot of heat when turned on.
The ones used for this build are average, consumer grade quality LEDs bought on Amazon.
A detailed specification of the product is given in table~\ref{tbl:LED_specs}.

A five meter long and 10 mm wide LED strip is cut into pieces of 15 cm length, each having nine LEDs.
These smaller strips are placed next to each other and glued onto a wooden plate forming the base for the backlight.
Corresponding ends of the strips are reconnected by soldering small pieces of wire onto the contacts of the strips.
For an easier soldering process and to reduce the risk of an electrical short, the strips are alternately offset by a small amount as shown in figure~\ref{fig:look_inside_backlight_2}.
A connector for the power supply is mounted on one end of the strip.
Wooden stand-offs glued to the base hold the diffuser plate 17 mm above the LEDs.
The diffuser is simply a white, milky acrylic plate from a hardware store, cut to the right size.
Finally, the build is concluded with a wooden frame covering the LEDs and wires and holding the glass plates in place.
The frame is painted with a color varnish to protect the wood from scratches and to beautify the product.

A total of three backlights were produced for this project.
All three displays are powered by a 12V/6A DC power supply.
The set also includes a remote control to turn the displays on and off or to adjust the brightness level.
